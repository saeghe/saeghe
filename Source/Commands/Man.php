           <command> [<args>]

These are common Saeghe commands used in various situations:

start a working area
    init {--packages-directory=}
                    Initializes the project. This command adds required files and directories. You can pass a
                    `packages-directory` as an option. If passed, then your packages will be added under the given
                    directory instead of the default `Packages` directory.
    migrate  
                    Migrate from a Composer project to a Saeghe project.

work with packages
    add <package> {--version=}
                    Adds the given package to your project. This command needs a required `package` argument. You can 
                    pass an optional `version` option, then Saeghe will add the given version of the given package, 
                    otherwise, it adds the latest released version on the package. The package’s source code will be 
                    added under your package’s directory, the package's path and installed version will be added to your
                     `saeghe.config.json` file and its metadata will be added to the `saeghe.config-lock.json` file.
    remove <package>
                    Removes the given package from your project. This command needs a required `package` argument. It 
                    deleted given package's source files from your packages directory and also removes the package from
                    `saeghe.config.json` and its metadata from `saeghe.config-lock.json`.
    update <package> {--version=}
                    If you need to get the latest version of an added package, you can run the update command. This 
                    command needs a required `package` argument. You can also path an optional `version` option, if 
                    passed, then Saeghe will download the exact version number, if not passed, it downloads the latest 
                    available version.
    install
                    When you clone your project, you don't have your packages source code (unless you didn't add your
                    packages directory to the .gitignore file, which is not recommended) After the clone, by running 
                    install command, Saeghe will download added packages to your packages directory.
work on an existing project
    build [{dev}|production]
                    Builds project and adds built files to environment's build directory under the `build` directory. By
                    default environment will be `development`. You can pass the environment argument as `production` 
                    when you want to build the production environment.
    watch
                    By running this command, Saeghe builds your file while you are doing your development. This command
                    always builds files under the `development` environment.
    flush
                    If you need to delete any built files, running this command will give you a fresh `builds` directory.
